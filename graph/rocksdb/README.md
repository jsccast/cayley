Experimental support for [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/).

You'll need the RockDB shared object library to build this code.

You'll also need [this fork](https://github.com/jsccast/rocksdb) of
this [RocksDB Go wrapper](https://github.com/DanielMorsing/rocksdb).
(Those repos should be renamed.)

See `rocksdb.cfg` at the top of this repo for some configuration
options.
